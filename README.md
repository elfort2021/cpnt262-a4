## JSON Gallery Endpoints with Fetch

### Eleanor Forte, 000841873

Well, heres to better late than never eh?? Thanks for this.
Just getting my directory set up and everything moved over from a3. (2:13pm)

Set up all my directories and trasnferred everything over. Kyle and Erica helped me with the fetch but I don't know if I even did the .env right or at all? Also couldn't figure out how to get the day js involved. But, a swing none the less.
Thanks Tony.
